# Customer Churn Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts customer churn using machine learning classification models. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave a service and provide actionable business insights.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset
- Telco Customer Churn Dataset
- Target Variable: Churn (Yes / No)

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing and encoding
3. Feature selection and train-test split
4. Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
5. Model evaluation
6. Churn probability prediction
7. Visualization and insights

## 📈 Results
- Random Forest achieved higher accuracy than Logistic Regression
- Key churn drivers: Contract type, Monthly charges, Tenure

## 💡 Business Insights
- Month-to-month customers churn more
- High monthly charges increase churn risk
- Low tenure customers require retention focus

## 🚀 Conclusion
The model successfully predicts customer churn and helps businesses take proactive retention actions.
